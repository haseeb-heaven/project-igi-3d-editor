# Smart live testing status

Date: 2026-09-07
Branch: `e2e-live-testing`

## Current gate

`Invoke-SmartNativeCaptureSession.ps1` is the strict native capture path
behind `Run-SmartTest.ps1` and `e2e_live_test.cmd`. It launches one editor
process with WMI `Win32_Process.Create` in interactive Session 1, verifies the
process is responsive, and captures target-scoped visual evidence. The default
`-VisualIntegrityPolicy Required` requires both loader evidence and a visual
integrity `PASS` for each selected object. `ReportOnly` is diagnostic and is
not release acceptance.

The visual analyzer is generic and deterministic. It evaluates object/material
ID masks, depth evidence, projected submesh coverage, and independently
rendered MEF attachment coverage. It does not contain model-specific rules or
an image classifier. Loader transform/texture records are retained separately
so they cannot mask missing rendered parts.

The native capture emits a fixed set of 16 views (12 exterior poses and four
interior views). `-ViewCount` controls the number of selected records copied
into each object result; the default is 10. Completion waits for all emitted
evidence files before shared capture paths are restored.

## Level 12 strict fixtures

The two authored fixtures are deliberately run together:

| Fixture | Model | Authored task ID | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Watchtower | `405_02_1` | `570` | visual `PASS` |
| WinchHouse | `463_01_1` | `-1#907` | visual `PASS` with no findings |

The recorded batch is `PASS`: loader and visual evidence pass for both objects,
including the formerly incomplete WinchHouse attachment coverage.

Rerun the pair with explicit task identity and a fresh artifact directory:

```powershell
$native = 'D:\Code\project-igi-editor\tools\e2e\Invoke-SmartNativeCaptureSession.ps1'
$out = 'D:\Code\project-igi-editor\artifacts\visual-integrity-level12-' + (Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd-HHmmss)
& pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $native `
  -GameRoot D:\IGI1 -EditorExePath D:\Code\project-igi-editor\bin\Release\igi1ed.exe `
  -Level 12 -Category Buildings -ModelIds '405_02_1,463_01_1' `
  -TaskIds '570,-1#907' -MaxObjects 0 -ViewCount 10 -Video `
  -VisualIntegrityPolicy Required -ArtifactsRoot $out
```

The convenience wrapper does not expose `-TaskIds` or
`-VisualIntegrityPolicy`; use the direct script for this fixture contract.
The runner passes `task=<id>` to the editor command watcher and preserves the
same value in `batch.json`, `evidence.jsonl`, visual-integrity records, and the
per-object directory name, including anonymous IDs such as `-1#907`.

## Recorded evidence

The verified live batch is retained at:

`artifacts/visual-integrity-level12-depthfix-20260907-155140/batch.json`

It records one WMI launch and close, 20 selected screenshots, the inventory and
editor SHA-256 values, loader evidence, and visual status for both fixtures.
The one-view task-ID smoke evidence is at:

`artifacts/visual-integrity-taskid-smoke-20260907/`

Per-object evidence directories contain the selected stills,
`visual-integrity.json`, `evidence.jsonl`, object/material masks, depth data,
and diagnostic overlays. Live images, videos, and generated JSON are local
artifacts; they are not source files to commit.

## Verification boundary

- The Release Win32 editor build was verified before this status update.
- `VisualIntegrityTest.*`: 6/6 passed locally.
- The full local binary registered 675 tests from 107 suites and ran 601
  passing, 33 skipped, and 41 failing. The failed parser/runtime-data and
  `VerifyLevelIntegration` cases are environment-gated because this checkout
  lacks the installed mission corpus under `bin\Release\missions`; they are
  not a clean full-suite release result.
- `git diff --check` and dashboard Python compilation passed for the existing
  implementation work. This documentation update does not change C++ or
  PowerShell implementation files.
