# Coding Guidelines

These guidelines define the engineering bar for the Windows gameplay runtime.
They adapt Matt Pocock's emphasis on explicit contracts, narrow seams, and
readable code to this C++20 codebase.

## Design principles

- Keep runtime state separate from editor/source state. Runtime objects own
  mutable simulation data; editor objects are read-only inputs to a session.
- Prefer small, single-purpose types and functions with one reason to change.
  A class should expose the smallest public interface that its callers need.
- Use dependency injection at subsystem boundaries. Collision, time, input,
  visibility, and native script calls must be replaceable in headless tests.
- Use RAII and value semantics for ownership. `std::unique_ptr` expresses
  exclusive ownership; `std::shared_ptr` is reserved for an intentional tree
  or graph lifetime. Never encode ownership in a raw pointer.
- Make invalid states difficult to represent. Use scoped enums, named structs,
  explicit units, bounded counts, and checked operations at external inputs.
- Treat OpenIGI behavior as `verified-reference` evidence. Mark inferred or
  placeholder behavior in the code and tests; do not imply retail parity
  without repeatable IGI1 evidence.

## Naming and readability

- Use descriptive full names for variables, parameters, and public methods.
  Avoid abbreviations such as `gq`, `dt`, `obs`, or `tmp` in new code.
- Use `PascalCase` for types and `camelCase` for functions and variables. Keep
  existing public names only when changing them would break the branch API.
- Keep one concept at one abstraction level per function. Extract a named
  helper when a function needs a comment to explain a control-flow block.
- Prefer early returns for invalid input and guard conditions. Keep the happy
  path visually linear.
- Comments explain intent, invariants, evidence, or a non-obvious trade-off.
  They must not restate the code. Every reference-derived constant carries an
  evidence label when its provenance matters.

## C++20 rules

- Prefer `const`, references, `std::span`, and `std::string_view` where they
  make ownership and mutation explicit. Do not copy large runtime data without
  a reason.
- Initialize every member at its declaration or in the constructor. Avoid
  sentinel values when an enum or `std::optional` communicates the state.
- Check bounds, stack depth, instruction pointers, call depth, and resource
  counts at every untrusted boundary. A malformed level or script must fail
  safely and deterministically.
- Keep platform APIs behind Windows-specific adapters. Gameplay logic must not
  depend on OpenGL, Win32 window handles, or editor globals.
- Use `std::chrono` or the repository's monotonic clock boundary for time.
  Simulation code receives fixed-step data and never derives gameplay from
  render-frame delta time.
- Do not use exceptions for ordinary gameplay outcomes. Return a result,
  boolean, or explicit state for expected failure; reserve exceptions for
  programmer contract violations or unrecoverable setup errors.

## DRY and SOLID in practice

- Share domain rules, not incidental implementation. A helper is justified
  when the same rule has at least two real callers and a single source of truth
  improves correctness.
- Keep interfaces focused (Interface Segregation) and depend on abstractions
  at system boundaries (Dependency Inversion). Avoid speculative frameworks.
- Favor composition over inheritance. Inheritance is appropriate for the
  existing task lifecycle seam or a genuinely substitutable runtime type.
- Do not hide side effects behind getters or utility functions. Names should
  make mutation, allocation, I/O, and platform work apparent.

## TDD and verification

- Work in vertical red-green-refactor slices. Write one behavior test at a
  public seam, make it fail for the intended reason, implement the smallest
  change, then refactor only after it is green.
- Tests describe observable behavior, not private fields or implementation
  details. Use deterministic fakes for terrain, collision, visibility, input,
  and native calls.
- Every bug fix adds a regression test. Every placeholder replaced by runtime
  behavior gets a focused test and an evidence label.
- Before claiming completion, run `git diff --check`, the focused tests, the
  Windows CMake build, and the full test target when the environment permits.
  If Windows tooling is unavailable, report the exact verification gap.

## Review checklist

- Does the change preserve editor state across open, tick, restart, and close?
- Are ownership, units, time boundaries, and failure behavior explicit?
- Can the behavior be tested without a renderer or native Windows window?
- Are names, comments, and error messages precise enough for a new maintainer?
- Is the implementation the smallest complete vertical slice, with no
  speculative abstraction or unverified parity claim?
